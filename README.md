### Notes

* The case only supports 1u outer row. 
* Currently, the plate only support 1u thumb cluster keys, but the plate may be easily adapted to support 2u keys.
* Only one stl is provided for each part. Mirror the parts depending on your setup.
* Plates with and without supports are provided. The version without supports is mainly meant for cutting out from acrylic etc.
* Use as small and narrow M3 inserts as possible, some of the wider ones may not fit.
* Use countersunk screws.
* Feet should be printed in TPU or any other soft filament (for better grip).
* The case supports PCB thickness of about 1.55-1.65 mm.
* This case is not made to print fast or save filament, it's thick, robust, and strong.
